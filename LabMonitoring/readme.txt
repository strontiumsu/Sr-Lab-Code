Main file containts the arduino folders for the code that runs the Arduino -> InfluxDB -> Grafana monitoring platform. There is a 1) water cooling system file which monitors temperature, pressure, and flow of the water cooling system for the MOT coils, 2) a main experiment table system which measures a temperature, pressure, and humidity in close proximity to the experiment, and 3) which monitors the temperature above the main experiment (for temp gradiant) and also takes OMW data from the Palo Alto station to compare with outside conditions.
